# Version
Beta 2

Tested on GZDoom 4.3.3
# Demon Souls
Inspired by the namesake, Demon Souls is a mod for GZDoom that adds optional in-universe saving. Kill demons in order to collect their souls. After a certain amount, you can place a beacon that will store your progress. Be warned, though, as death is more punishing. You'll lose almost all your ammo and enemies will respawn and have their health reset. All hope is not lost, though, as your previous items and souls are dropped. Can you make it back to them? Let's hope so, because if you die again they're gone for good. Saving will prevent monsters you've killed from respawning. Make sure to use them wisely.
# How to Install
Download the master branch as a zip and then either drag and drop it onto your GZDoom executable or use a mod loader. This mod works with all Doom engine games and will work with other gameplay mods.
